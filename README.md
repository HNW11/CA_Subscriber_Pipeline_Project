# CA_SubscriberPipline_Project
Code Academy Project Portfolio

Scenario
You’ll be working with a mock database of long-term cancelled subscribers for a fictional subscription company. This database is regularly updated from multiple sources, and needs to be routinely cleaned and transformed into usable shape with as little human intervention as possible.

About the Data
It’s important to practice working with customer data, especially as a data engineer. But it would be unethical to share actual customer data, so we’ve developed a realistic but entirely fictional dataset for you to use. Because we’re an online education company, our version of the dataset is based around a fictional education company called Cademycode.

Project Objectives
